## In Short
The R way to interact with Google's Tag Manager API.

### Scope
At the moment listing of elements is available, but in the future both updates
 and delete will be supported. This is **not** a professional package and serves mostly as a way of organising code snippets for my work.

### Credits
Most of this is adopted from the excellent [autoGoogleAPI](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/autoGoogleAPI) package from [Mark Edmondson](r@sunholo.com) and his most awesome [googleAnalyticsR](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR) that I use daily.
